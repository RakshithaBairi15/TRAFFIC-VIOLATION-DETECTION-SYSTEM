# TRAFFIC-VIOLATION-DETECTION-SYSTEM
# 🚦 Traffic Violation Detection System using YOLOv8

An AI-powered system that detects vehicles violating red traffic signals using real-time object detection and tracking. Vehicles are labeled as **"Safe"** or **"Violated"** based on their movement relative to the red signal and stop line. This project works without any hardware sensors, making it cost-effective and scalable for smart city integration.
